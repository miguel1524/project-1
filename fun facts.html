    <h1>THE DANGEROUS THINGS ABOUT POKEMON GO!</H1>
    <P>EVERDAY SINCE POKEN GO CAME OUT IT HAS BEEN IN THE NEWS
      BUT NOT FOR GOOD THINGS.IT HAS BEEN IN THE NEWS FOR PEOPLE DYING.
      AN EXAMPLE IS WHEN A GIRL WAS WALKING AND SHE FELL IN THE RIVER.
      THIS GAME CAN BE VERY FUN BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT CAN BE DANGEROUS.
    <h1>POKEMON GENERATIONS</H1>
    <P>POKEMON HAS A TOTAL OF 7 GENERATIONS.THE ONE THAT POKEMON GO IS ON IS
      GENERATION  1.THIS GENERATION HAS ALL OF THE CLASSICS LIKE CHARIZARD
      PIKACHU MEWTWO AND MEW.MAYBE IN THE FUTURE POKEMON GO MAYBE ADD THE
      OTHER GENERATIONS LIKE THE 2 AND 3 ONE.THAT WILL BE VERY COOL BECUASE
      I MISS THE POKEMON FROM GEN 2 AND 3 AND I CANT WAIT TO CATCH THEM ALL.
      AS YOU GUYS CAN SEE MY FAVORITE POKEMON IS CHARIZARD.
